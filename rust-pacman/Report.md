# Rust Pac Man
## Summary
	Rust Pac Man is a Rust implementation of the classic arcade game Pac Man. The player controls Pac Man through a maze to consume pellets, which in turn give points. The goal is to consume all of the pellets without losing all of your lives, so you must avoid the ghosts chasing you. You can consume mega pellets to scare off the ghosts and cause them to change into frightened mode. Once in frightened mode, Pac Man can consume them, in which case they will return home. Once ghosts return home, they chase again. The game is over once all of the pellets have been consumed or Pac Man loses all of his lives. The game uses Piston, a modular open source game engine for Rust, to establish the board and all of the drawable components in the game as well as to render 2d images.
